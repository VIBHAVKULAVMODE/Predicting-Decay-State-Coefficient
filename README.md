## Power bi report:
       Page 1-2: Shows the relationship of some variables with GT compressor and GT Turbine decay coefficients.
                 Variables which show linear relationship with the target variables have been mostly avoided.
                 The graphs shows variables that have some intresting relationship as the target variable varies.
                 The decay coefficient has been divided into 3 groups: Warning  (Decay coefficient < 0.98)
                                                                       Critical (Decay coefficient < 0.99)
                                                                       Fail     (Decay coefficient > 0.99)
                 On selecting one of the above groups in the pie chart the behaviour of the variables can be seen.                            
       
       Page 4-5: Contains graphs to show distribution of variables.
